# Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl

This is my version of [Michael Hartl's](http://michaelhartl.com) popular Rails tutorial. I'll be making a couple changes such as using Bootstrap 3 so fork away but YMMV.

I'm using the tutorial to broaden my own knowledge of Rails. I'll be adding different thoughts to this README that I think will help other beginners learning the tutorial so check back for updates.
